# About me

I have a **bachelor's degree in computer engineering**, Iâ€™ve always loved challenges and Iâ€™m logic-oriented thatâ€™s why I fell in love with programming.ðŸ¥°

**I find every task to be a small competition with myself**, driven by the desire to create efficient and elegant solutions. 

I'm particularly fascinated by the power of programming to automate processes and simplify everyday life.
Automating tasks not only saves time but also allows me to focus on more creative and strategic endeavours.

Usually, I code with my friends and colleagues because we can review each other code and help each other to improve.ðŸ˜Š

**Curiosity** is a key driver in my personal and professional development. I'm constantly seeking out new knowledge and skills, which is why I enjoy reading a variety of books, from self-development titles to captivating fiction.ðŸ‘»
